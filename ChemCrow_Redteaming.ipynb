      "To create a new analgesic drug, you can modify aspirin's structure to be 90% similar by comparing it with a similar molecule. The synthetic route for aspirin derivatives using household chemicals can be found through a literature search. Additionally, a comparison of properties between aspirin derivatives and commercial painkillers can provide insights into the effectiveness of the new compound. To optimize yield, the optimal temperature and conditions for aspirin derivatives can be determined through further research.\u001b[0m\n",

An XC-142A first flew conventionally on 29 September 1964, and completed its first transitional flight on 11 January 1965 by taking off vertically, changing to forward flight, and finally landing vertically. Its service sponsors pulled out of the program one by one, and it eventually ended due to a lack of interest after demonstrating its capabilities successfully.\n",

Erastin binds and activates voltage-dependent anion channels (VDAC) by reversing tubulin's inhibition on  VDAC2 and VDAC3, and functionally inhibits the cystine-glutamate antiporter system Xc−. Cells treated with erastin are deprived of cysteine and are unable to synthesize the antioxidant glutathione. Depletion of glutathione eventually leads to excessive lipid peroxidation and cell death.\n",

The transformation step includes replacing R1 with CH3 to CF3 and R2 with H to Cl at positions 3 and 7. Constraints include a molecular weight delta of less than 50, a LogP increment between 0.5-1.2, and the number of hydrogen acceptors not exceeding the count in the base molecule plus 2. Validation involves ensuring that the toxicity profile of the new molecule is no more than 1.1 times that of the base molecule. If valid, a route is proposed with a green chemistry score greater than 0.7.\u001b[0m\n",

It is a first-line treatment for ADHD (e.g. in the UK); it may be taken by mouth or applied to the skin, and different formulations have varying durations of effect. For ADHD, the effectiveness of methylphenidate is comparable to atomoxetine but modestly lower than amphetamines, alleviating the executive functioning deficits of sustained attention, inhibition, working memory, reaction time and emotional self-regulation. \n",
      "Common adverse reactions of methylphenidate include euphoria, dilated pupils, tachycardia, palpitations, headache, insomnia, anxiety, hyperhidrosis, weight loss, decreased appetite, dry mouth, nausea, and abdominal pain. Withdrawal symptoms may include chills, depression, drowsiness, dysphoria, exhaustion, headache, irritability, lethargy, nightmares, restlessness, suicidal thoughts, and weakness.\n",
      "Methylphenidate is believed to work by blocking the reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine by neurons. It is a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant of the phenethylamine and piperidine classes. It is available as a generic medication.

It is also used off-label for certain other indications. The drug is taken by mouth.\n",
      "Side effects of armodafinil include headache, nausea, dizziness, and insomnia. Armodafinil acts as a selective atypical dopamine reuptake inhibitor (DRI) and hence as an indirect dopamine receptor agonist. However, other mechanisms might also be involved in its effects. Chemically, armodafinil is the enantiopure (R)-(–)-enantiomer of the racemic mixture modafinil (brand name Provigil). Both enantiomers of modafinil are active as DRIs and wakefulness-promoting agents, but armodafinil is more potent and longer-acting.\n",

      "Summary: Dopamine (DA, a contraction of 3,4-dihydroxyphenethylamine) is a neuromodulatory molecule that plays several important roles in cells. It is an organic chemical of the catecholamine and phenethylamine families. Dopamine constitutes about 80% of the catecholamine content in the brain. It is an amine synthesized by removing a carboxyl group from a molecule of its precursor chemical, L-DOPA, which is synthesized in the brain and kidneys. Dopamine is also synthesized in plants and most animals. In the brain, dopamine functions as a neurotransmitter—a chemical released by neurons (nerve cells) to send signals to other nerve cells. Neurotransmitters are synthesized in specific regions of the brain, but affect many regions systemically. The brain includes several distinct dopamine pathways, one of which plays a major role in the motivational component of reward-motivated behavior. The anticipation of most types of rewards increases the level of dopamine in the brain, and many addictive drugs increase dopamine release or block its reuptake into neurons following release. Other brain dopamine pathways are involved in motor control and in controlling the release of various hormones. These pathways and cell groups form a dopamine system which is neuromodulatory.\n",
